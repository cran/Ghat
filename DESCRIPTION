Description: Functions are provided for quantifying evolution and selection on complex traits. 
              The package implements effective handling and analysis algorithms scaled for 
              genome-wide data and calculates a composite statistic, denoted Ghat, which is used 
              to test for selection on a trait. The package provides a number of simple examples 
              for handling and analysing the genome data and visualising the output and results.
